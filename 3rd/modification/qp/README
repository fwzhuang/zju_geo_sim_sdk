This small library is a C wrapper to an ancient public FORTRAN code originally 
written by Powell and modified by Schittkowski. I am not sure whetherthis code
is still state-of-the-art or not, but it works well in our inverse models with
up to a thousand variables.

There is no warranty whatsoever.  Use at your own risk.

These code may be freely redistributed under the condition that the copyright
notices are not removed. You may distribute modified versions of this code
UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THIS CODE AND ANY MODIFICATIONS MADE TO IT IN THE
SAME FILE REMAIN UNDER COPYRIGHT OF CSIRO, BOTH SOURCE AND OBJECT CODE ARE
MADE FREELY AVAILABLE WITHOUT CHARGE, AND CLEAR NOTICE IS GIVEN OF THE
MODIFICATIONS.

This code has been written and used under Linux/gcc platform. You probably
will be able to port it to others provided that f2c converter is available.

To compile it, run:

configure
make
(make install)

You may now use qp_solve() in your code, just add "#include <qp.h>"
to the top and "-lqp -lf2c -lm" to the linker options.

Good luck!
Pavel Sakov
